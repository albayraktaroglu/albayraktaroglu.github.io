During my undergraduate years, my main goal was to experience as many different fields of computer science as I could. I developed at least one project in each computer vision(OpenCV, scikit-image), mobile programming(Android), web programming fields(.NET MVC & Flask). Recently I had a chance to take a look at Machine Learning(scikit-learn & theano) field. So for last one year I am working as a Cognitive Computing Engineer in NY.

Like to being a Full Stack Developer and taking pictures...

Interested to work in `Web Development`, `Computer Vision` and `Machine Learning`
